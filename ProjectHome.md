This project contains resources for a new font compression format, WOFF 2.0, intended to improve WOFF upon WOFF. It includes reference code, an experiment framework, and will also be the repository for a conformance test suite. The reference compressor is written in C++ and uses OTS (the OpenType Sanitizer).
